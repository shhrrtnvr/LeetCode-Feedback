In the 30 day leetcoding Challenge, The Maximal Square problem description says to find the largest square matrix with all ones.
Square matrix is the one that hase equal number of row and column
However, there is a testcase in judge dataset that gives the wrong output

1 0 1 1 0 1 
1 1 1 1 1 1 
0 1 1 0 1 1 
1 1 1 0 1 0 
0 1 1 1 1 1 
1 1 0 1 1 1 

In this testcase the maximum "square" with all one has area 4.
But the judge gives 16 which is a rectangular area.
So, there is either the description should state rectangular area or the judge answer should be corrected to 4
